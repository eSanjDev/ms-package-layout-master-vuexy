## 🗂 Menu System

Menu is managed via dynamic JSON located at:

```
resources/menu/menu.json
```

* Nested menus / Submenus (∞ depth)
* Slug and permission-based visibility
* Badges and icons

### Example:

```json
{
    "menu": [
        {
            "url": "/admin",
            "name": "Dashboard",
            "icon": "menu-icon icon-base ti tabler-smart-home",
            "slug": "admin.dashboard"
        },
        {
            "name": "Manager",
            "icon": "menu-icon icon-base ti tabler-Admins",
            "slug": "managers",
            "submenu": [
                {
                    "url": "/admin/managers/create",
                    "name": "Create New Manager",
                    "slug": "admin.managers.create",
                    "permission": "managers.create"
                },
                {
                    "url": "/admin/managers",
                    "name": "Managers List",
                    "slug": "managers.index",
                    "permission": "managers.list"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### ✨ The menu system supports:

* icon: Full CSS classes for icon
* target: set to "_blank" if you need external link
* permission: optional permission for menu visibility

## ⚙ Usage in Blade

Your pages should extend the provided layouts.master:

### Example:

```php
@extends('layouts.master')

@section('title', 'Dashboard')

@section('vendor-style')
   @vite([
     'resources/assets/vendor/libs/chartjs/chartjs.scss'
   ])
@endsection

@section('page-style')
   @vite([
     'resources/assets/vendor/scss/pages/dashboard.scss'
   ])
@endsection

@section('content')
   <div class="container">Welcome to the dashboard</div>
@endsection

@section('vendor-script')
   @vite([
     'resources/assets/vendor/libs/chartjs/chartjs.js'
   ])
@endsection

@section('page-script')
   @vite([
     'resources/assets/js/pages/dashboard.js'
   ])
@endsection
```
